## shipguard

Problem
Teams run container scans but don’t know whether they can safely deploy.

What shipguard does
Shipguard converts vulnerability scan output into a clear deployment verdict with human-readable reasoning.

What shipguard is not

Not a vulnerability scanner

Not a security gatekeeper

Not a compliance tool

How it works

Ingests Trivy scan output

Normalizes findings

Evaluates deployment risk

Produces a verdict

Why
Because security findings are useless if engineers can’t act on them.
